# Most of the time will be spent manipulating the data
# Must manipulate the data with code, not editing the txt file
# for add new year data, should have user be able to input data for every column in the database 
# only need to query the database and add new columns, don't need to edit data 
# commas exist in comments so you need to edit the data before splitting by commas 
# don't actually need to normalize
